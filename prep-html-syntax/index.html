  <p style="color:blueviolet">R2D2 is my favorite Star Wars character for many reasons. It's rather obvious that he is the most loyal of the characters and would never desert any of his companions. Aside from the fact that he holds much utility within his arsenal of weaponry, he's a great friend to have along the journey.</p>
